This code exists becuase I was too lazy to learn Igor, so I found a way to play with the waves I recorded during optogenetics assisted circuit mapping experiments.

```PygorPro``` series is for the analysis of patching data.

```ePhysFig``` for generating figures for patching data

```BehavePro``` series analyses the output from simba, using ethovision hardware control logs to synchronise spike timing.

```BehavFig``` templates for generating figures for behavioral experiments

```BehaveVid``` series generates videos with the analysed data.

```Archive``` contains early versions/precursors of the other notebooks.
