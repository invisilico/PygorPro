This code exists becuase I was too lazy to learn Igor, so I found a way to play the waves I recorded by patch clamp ephys.

intended uses:

identify protocols

analyse peak amplitudes, throw away bad data

generate plots automatically with Rs and Cs

generate entire figure page for each cell in vector graphics

Dependencies:
Igor (packag by wking)
Matplotlib.pyplot
numpy
pandas
os
seaborn
