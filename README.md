This code exists becuase I was too lazy to learn Igor, so I found a way to play with the waves I recorded during optogenetics assisted circuit mapping experiments.

The ```PygorPro``` series is for the analysis of patching data.

The ```BehavePro``` series analyses the output from simba, using ethovision hardware control logs to synchronise spike timing.

The ```BehaveVid``` series generates videos with the analysed data.
